# Contributing to mtb

## Philosophy

Keep it light. mtb wraps existing tools (scc, syft) rather than reimplementing them. New features should follow this pattern.

## Before Contributing

Run mtb on your proposed feature:

mtb consult "your feature idea"

If mtb tells you it already exists, maybe it shouldn't be added.

## Guidelines

- Small PRs over large ones
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- If it can be a separate tool, it probably should be
- Tests should pass

## Questions mtb Should Ask

The best contributions add questions that would have prevented real over-engineering you've witnessed. Share the story in your PR.
