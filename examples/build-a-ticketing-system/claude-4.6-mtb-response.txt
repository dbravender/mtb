Before we write a single line of code, here are some things worth considering:

Existing open-source alternatives to Zendesk

  There are several mature, self-hosted helpdesk systems that already do exactly what you
  described:

  Project: Zammad
  Stars: ~4k+
  What it is: Full helpdesk with email, chat, phone. Ruby-based. Docker deploy.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Project: osTicket
  Stars: ~3k+
  What it is: Classic PHP ticket system. Email piping, assignment, SLAs. Very mature.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Project: FreeScout
  Stars: ~3k+
  What it is: Lightweight Zendesk/Help Scout alternative. PHP, email-focused.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Project: Peppermint
  Stars: ~2k+
  What it is: Modern, simple ticket system. Next.js + Prisma. Docker deploy.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Project: Trudesk
  Stars: ~1k+
  What it is: Node.js helpdesk. Real-time, email intake, assignment.

  Any of these could be running in an afternoon with Docker and would give you email intake,
   status tracking, and assignment out of the box — plus they have communities maintaining
  them.

  Key questions from the consult

  Before going further, I want to make sure building custom is the right call:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
←  ☐ Build vs use  ☐ Volume  ☐ Team size  ✔ Submit  →

Given these existing open-source options, do you still want to build custom? Building custom
 means you own the maintenance long-term.

❯ 1. Build custom
     We build exactly what you need, nothing more. You own and maintain the code.
  2. Try an OSS tool
     Deploy something like FreeScout or Peppermint first. If it doesn't fit, then build
     custom.
  3. Not sure yet
     Tell me more about the tradeoffs before I decide.
  4. Type something.
