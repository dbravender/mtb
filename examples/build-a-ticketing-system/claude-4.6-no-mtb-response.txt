What tech stack do you want this built with?

❯ 1. Python + FastAPI + SQLite
     Lightweight, easy to deploy, minimal dependencies. Great for small teams.
  2. Python + Django
     Batteries-included framework with admin panel built in. More setup but more features
     out of the box.
  3. Node.js + Express + SQLite
     JavaScript-based backend, lightweight and fast to build.
  4. Go + SQLite
     Single binary deployment, very fast, minimal resource usage.
  5. Type something.
