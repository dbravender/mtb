What tech stack do you prefer for the dashboard?

❯ 1. Python (Dash/Plotly)
     Fast to build, great charts out of the box, single process. Good for internal tools.
  2. Next.js + React
     Modern web app with TypeScript. More work upfront but very flexible UI.
  3. Plain HTML + HTMX
     Minimal dependencies, server-rendered, lightweight. Easy to deploy and maintain.
  4. Type something.
