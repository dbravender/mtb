● I'd be happy to build a simple internal wiki for your team. Let me plan this out first since it involves several components.

What tech stack do you want for this wiki?

❯ 1. Python (Flask/SQLite)
     Lightweight, easy to deploy, single binary-like setup. Great for small-medium teams.
  2. Node.js (Express/SQLite)
     JavaScript everywhere, good if your team already works in JS/TS.
  3. Go (single binary)
     Compiles to a single binary, very fast, minimal dependencies.
  4. Type something.
